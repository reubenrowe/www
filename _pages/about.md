I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the
[Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk) at
[Royal Holloway, University of London](https://www.rhul.ac.uk).
I also have a [RHUL web page](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/reuben-rowe(70354339-7bc5-475d-b8d5-7fa95114d851).html).

I do research in the areas of programming language semantics and formal verification,
as well as some logic and proof theory.
I am also interested in type systems,
in particular intersection types and guarded recursive types,
and fundamental models of computation such as &lambda;-calculus,
term rewriting systems, and process calculi.

From 2016&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the
[PLAS](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/) group at the
[University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk), and in the
[PPLV](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) group at
[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)
from 2014&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;2016.
Prior to that, I was as a Teaching Fellow in the
[Department of Computing](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at
[Imperial College London](https://www.ic.ac.uk/), where I was responsible for
teaching and admissions for the MSc in Computing Science.
In another life, I also worked in industry as a web developer.
I was awarded my MSc in Advanced Computing with Distinction in 2008,
and my PhD in 2013, both from Imperial College London.
I obtained my BA in Computer Science from the
[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)
[Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) in 2004,
where I was a member of [Fitzwilliam College](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/).

I currently teach the 1<sup>st</sup> year programming labs (CS1822)
and the Object-Oriented Programming II module (CS1812/13).
Please see my [teaching]({{  '/teaching/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}) page for more details.
