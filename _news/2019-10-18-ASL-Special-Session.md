I am organising a Special Session on Proof Theory at the
[2020 ASL North American Annual Meeting](https://sites.uci.edu/asl2020/),
to be held at UC Irvine, in California, in March 2020.
My co-organisers are
  [Elaine Pimentel](https://sites.google.com/site/elainepimentel/) and
  [Valeria de Paiva](https://vcvpaiva.github.io/).
